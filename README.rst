Arch Linux PKGBUILDs, mostly related to bioinformatics and
scientific computing.

They come in several categories:

- **aur/** - Packages uploaded to the AUR, maintained by me.

- **forks/** - Packages that are in the AUR, are not maintained by
  me, but have been modified in some way from the AUR version.

- **experimental/** - Packages that are not in the AUR, and that I
  haven't uploaded to the AUR, possibly because I feel they are too
  localized or might still contain bugs.

- **systemd/** - Packages that add systemd services for existing
  packages.

The packages in aur/ should work and be stable. Please feel free to
report bugs with any packages in the aur/ folder to me, either  on
Github Issues or on the relevant package's comments section on the
AUR.

Those packages in the other folders are in various stages of development; some
work, some don't. Use them at your own risk.
